# Relaxation Spa

## Project Description

This is a website that resembles a spa business; it offers services and a selection of products for purchase. It does not have full-blown features like a real e-commerce website; instead, a user can "buy" services or products by clicking the `Add` button and will see the total value displayed dynamically on the screen upon each click. The website contains the following pages:

**1. Home Page**

   - Used reusable Button component to redirect the user to the Services page or to the Products page.

**2. Services Page**

   - When the user clicks on the `Add` button of a service, the respective price is automatically added to the total on the bottom of the page. The user will see the total value update dynamically upon each click event. The user is able to buy as many services as they want by simply clicking on that item repeatedly. Tax is not calculated on this page.

**3. Products Page**

   - Similar to the Services page but with a couple of additions. Tax is calculated on this page, so the subtotal and total are displayed for the user. When the user clicks on a product, it automatically adds its respective price to the subtotal (before tax) and to the total (after tax). The user will see the subtotal and total values update dynamically upon each click event. And again, the user can buy as many of each product as they want by simply clicking on that item repeatedly.

**4. Book Appointment Page**
   - Contains a simple contact form. Form validation not implemented. When the user clicks on the submit button, the entered values are displayed in the console as one object.
